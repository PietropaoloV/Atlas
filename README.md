# Atlas

# Contributors
this project was meant for 12 students but due to laziness, and general disregard for work the team size was reduced significantly.  if you are here as a recruiter please be advised that Zachary Asis did not work on this project or contribute in a meaningful way. Most of the code written by this individual was generated by chatgpt.
